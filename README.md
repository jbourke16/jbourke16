### Hello, world! I'm Jennifer üëãüèº

I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Digital Marketing and SEO & SEM. Welcome to my GitHub!

If I'm not challenging myself to learn new coding languages or work on new projects, you'll probably find me playing video games (most likely Baldur's Gate 3, again) or hanging out with my cat, Link.
